# WTMapLocker

WarThunder unusual maps locker allows you to block unwanted maps.

The program must be launched after starting the game, and be sure to close it after exiting the game in order to restore the changed files from the backup. Otherwise, the next time you start the launcher, it will try to restore the original files, which takes a lot of time.
